"""Tests for critical bug fixes in the backtest engine.

These tests ensure that previously discovered bugs don't regress:
1. Kalman spread sign convention (should be log_x - hr*log_y, not reversed)
2. Volatility sizing using diff() instead of pct_change()
3. Half-life formula (phi = 1 + b, HL = -ln(2)/ln(phi))
4. Spread convention consistency across all modules
